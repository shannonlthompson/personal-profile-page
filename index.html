        <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I coded my first program in 2010, during the second semester of my junior year at Mills College. The class went well and I enjoyed it, so I enrolled in more!</p>
              <p>Those classes added up, and I earned an MA in interdisciplinary computer science in 2013. During those semesters at Mills, I spent my free moments working on Android apps, studying for my data structures class, and debugging programs. The MA program was daunting, but conquering each new coding project was also extremely rewarding. </p>
             
             
                <p>Computer science courses challenged me in an exciting way, but since I also enjoyed writing. I wanted a career that bridged those two interests, so after graduating, I took a job as a technical writer. Technical writing has furthered my interest in writing and technology over the last four years. <p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be more actively involved in the product development process, so I've decided to pivot to a more technical role. In my free time, I'm strengthening my coding skills in preparation for a shift to a front-end development team.</p>
          <p>In particular, I'm increasing my knowledge, skills, and abilities in:</p>
